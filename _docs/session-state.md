## Where We Are

Chapter 01 choreography is working correctly. Frosting appears on scroll. Markup is significantly cleaner than last session. A structural cleanup pass was completed before any new feature work — good hygiene before moving forward.

The next priority is the micro-alignment issues inside the bento and the chapter gap between C01 and C02.

## What's Working

- `<nav class="navbar">` — global, fixed, in `base.njk` ✓
- `<header class="page-header layout__chapter">` — sticky at `top: 64px`, correct z-index (90) ✓
- `page-header__frosting` — fixed sibling of header in `index.njk`, fades in at 176px scroll threshold ✓
- `page-header__inner` — pure layout/content container, no visual treatment ✓
- Layout grid — 6 tracks, all named lines correct, `1200px` total ✓
- `layout__narrative` / `layout__narrative--choreographed` — renamed from `layout__section` ✓
- `layout__page` is now the container query host for bento (`container-name: content-cell`) ✓
- `bento-grid` renders directly inside `layout__page` — no `content-cell` wrapper in bento path ✓
- Subgrid fully removed from `.chapter__bento` ✓
- `CHROME_TOP = 64` — bento sticks correctly just below navbar ✓
- Frosting bottom / bento row 1 bottom are flush ✓
- Chapter 01 beat choreography — `BEAT_PX = 300`, `OVERLAP = 0.5` ✓
- Skeletons disabled (`SHOW_SKELETON = false`) — code preserved ✓
- `addWatchTarget('src/assets/js/')` in `.eleventy.js` — JS changes trigger rebuild ✓

## Open Priorities

### 1. Micro-alignment inside bento + chapter gap (PRIORITY 1)
- Micro-alignment issues inside bento cells — not yet investigated
- Gap between C01 and C02 when C02 enters — `chapterOffset` negative margin logic may be fighting chapter row track geometry

### 2. Field text — extended page approach (PRIORITY 2)
Subgrid approach is dead. Agreed new approach: field text becomes part of P02, which gets an extended grid context spanning `content-start / bento-end`. No synchronization needed — JS translates the whole page as one unit.

**What this means:**
- `chapter__content` removed from template, SCSS, JS
- `fieldText` YAML moves from chapter level to P02's page level
- `.layout__page--extended` spans `content-start / bento-end`
- Mobile: field text gets `order: -1`

### 3. `content-header.njk` audit (PRIORITY 3)
Any template still referencing `{% include "components/header.njk" %}` will fail on build. Audit before next deploy.

## Deferred

- **Big screenshot element** — named lines in grid, implementation deferred until Section 2
- **Selfie scroll collision** — fade/animation, custom article work
- **Section 2** — not yet authored
- **`bento-arrow.njk`** — dead file, delete it
- **Skeletons** — re-enable after Section 2 is authored
- **Page header detached-on-load behavior** — frosting trigger is wired, visual treatment deferred
- **Sticky-stack section navigation** — deferred until all three case studies are compiled

## Rules (learned the hard way)

- Read Figma metadata before writing CSS. `get_metadata` first, every time.
- Verify in Chrome before declaring anything done. Screenshot + DevTools computed values.
- One change at a time. Verify, then move.
- Start fresh sessions earlier — long conversational sessions degrade work quality.
- Session ends one of two ways: PR doc written → Claude Code handles commit, OR this file updated. No other exit.
- `position: fixed` elements cannot be z-indexed behind their own parent — they must be siblings, not children.
- `grid-template-areas` with unnamed columns causes those columns to collapse — use named lines only.
- `padding-inline` on a grid container shifts all track origins — put viewport-edge protection inside columns, not on the container.
- Frosting is a page-type concern, not a header-internal concern — lives in the page template, not in the header include.
- `layout__page` is the container query host for bento. `container-name: content-cell` kept so placements SCSS fires without changes.
